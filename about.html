        <p class = "justify-left">IT'S ME, ELIOT, THE CREATOR OF WORD-WEBS, ANALOGS, AND MANY
            FUTURE WORD GAMES. I INVENTED AND MAINTAIN ALL THE GAMES YOU 
            SEE ON THIS SITE AND THEIR DAILY PUZZLES; THERE'S NO BIG MEDIA
            CORPORATION OR TEAM OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEM, JUST ME. I TRY TO POST NEW
            PUZZLES EVERY DAY AROUND 9PM PST (12AM EST), EXCEPT WHEN I DON'T
            MANAGE TO.

        <P class = "justify-left">
            IF YOU APPRECIATE THESE PUZZLES PLEASE CONSIDER SHARING THEM
            WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AND CONTRIBUTING PUZZLES OF YOUR
            OWN ALONG WITH SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS TO SUBMISSIONS@PLAYWORDWEBS.COM.
